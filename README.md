# ASCII-RLE

  
Hello,

I am trying to make a project in Python tkinter to decompress (To ASCII) and compress (To RLE) data.

The program needs to be able to decompress user-inputted RLE to ASCII in a proper way. 
The program needs to display ASCII from a user-inputted file name 
The program need to be able to convert RLE to ASCII and display the new ASCII 'art' 
The program need to be able to convert ASCII to RLE into a new text file

Any help will be much appreciated
